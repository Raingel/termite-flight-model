The termite-flight-model repository is designed to model and predict termite flight patterns by integrating environmental data. Below is an overview of the repository's structure and its primary components:

Repository Structure
The repository comprises several directories and Python scripts, each serving a specific function:

Directories:

__pycache__: Contains cached bytecode files for optimized performance.
db: Stores database files related to the project.
evaluation_results: Holds results from model evaluations.
models: Contains saved machine learning models.
output: Stores output data generated by the models.
splitted_data: Includes datasets split for training, validation, and testing purposes.
Key Python Scripts:

ensemble.py: Implements ensemble learning techniques to improve model performance.
evaluate_models.py: Contains functions to assess and validate the performance of different models.
fetch_data.py: Responsible for retrieving and processing environmental data relevant to termite flights.
generate_models.py: Scripts to initialize and train machine learning models.
main.py: Serves as the primary entry point for executing the project's workflow.
read_data.py: Handles the loading and preprocessing of datasets.
visualization.py: Contains functions for visualizing data and model outputs.
Getting Started
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/TermCIC/termite-flight-model.git
Navigate to the Project Directory:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd termite-flight-model
Install Required Dependencies:

Ensure you have Python installed. Then, install the necessary packages using pip:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
After setting up, you can execute the main workflow by running:

bash
Copy
Edit
python main.py
This script will initiate the data fetching, model training, evaluation, and visualization processes.
