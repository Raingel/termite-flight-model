# Termite Flight Model

The `termite-flight-model` repository is designed to model and predict termite flight patterns by integrating environmental data. Below is an overview of the repository's structure and its primary components.

## Repository Structure

The repository comprises several directories and Python scripts, each serving a specific function:

### Directories:
- **`__pycache__`**: Contains cached bytecode files for optimized performance.
- **`db`**: Stores database files related to the project.
- **`evaluation_results`**: Holds results from model evaluations.
- **`models`**: Contains saved machine learning models.
- **`output`**: Stores output data generated by the models.
- **`splitted_data`**: Includes datasets split for training, validation, and testing purposes.

### Key Python Scripts:
- **`ensemble.py`**: Implements ensemble learning techniques to improve model performance.
- **`evaluate_models.py`**: Contains functions to assess and validate the performance of different models.
- **`fetch_data.py`**: Responsible for retrieving and processing environmental data relevant to termite flights.
- **`generate_models.py`**: Scripts to initialize and train machine learning models.
- **`main.py`**: Serves as the primary entry point for executing the project's workflow.
- **`read_data.py`**: Handles the loading and preprocessing of datasets.
- **`visualization.py`**: Contains functions for visualizing data and model outputs.

## Getting Started

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

### Clone the Repository:
